        other events that run in the game.
        _update_screen(self): displays everything on the screen and updates anything on the screen to its new position.
        _check_keydown_event(self, event): Checks if the key is pressed down. Keys:
            K_Right: fires an event that makes the ship move right.
            K_Left: Ditto, but left.
            K_Space: Plays a sound when pressed and makes the ship fire a bullet.
            K_q: exits out of the game.
        _check_keyup_event(self, event): Checks if the key is not being pressed. if it isn't pressed, keep the ship completely still.
